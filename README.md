  ## Installation:
    Using this app, we installed multiple npms, to name a few: express, MySQL2, sequelize, express-handlebars, passport, and bcryptjs.

  ## Usage:
    When user logs in (or signs up), the are then brought to the homepage showing their username/email and are given the option to battle. After that they are brought to the character select page that will display each character's stats once they have been chosen. Once the character has been chosen and click the battle button, the computer chooses their character and the battle begins. The user is able to use a physical or magical attack that will cause more or less damage to the opponent depending on their defensive stats. Once a character's health reaches zero, the game ends.
